AI Development Workflow Projects
This repository showcases two distinct AI projects, demonstrating the complete AI development workflow from data simulation to model evaluation. Each project addresses a real-world problem and highlights key stages of an AI lifecycle.

Project 1: Student Dropout Prediction Model
This project focuses on predicting student dropout rates in an online learning platform.

Project Goal
To build a predictive model that identifies students at high risk of dropping out, enabling proactive interventions.

Workflow Covered
Data Generation: Simulates a dataset with student demographics and LMS activity.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales numerical features, and encodes categorical features. Includes a simple feature engineering step.

Model Development: Trains an XGBoost Classifier.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using F1-Score, AUC-ROC, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve plots.

How to Run
Save the code for this project as student_dropout_analysis.py.

Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn

Run from terminal: python student_dropout_analysis.py

Key Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn

Project 2: Hospital Readmission Risk Prediction Model
This project addresses the challenge of predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge in a hospital setting.

Project Goal
To develop an AI system that accurately predicts which patients are at high risk of readmission, facilitating targeted post-discharge care.

Workflow Covered
Data Generation: Simulates a dataset with patient demographics, clinical details, and lab values.

Data Preprocessing: Manages missing data, engineers new features (e.g., medication complexity), scales numerical features, and encodes categorical features.

Model Development: Trains an XGBoost Classifier.

Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using F1-Score, AUC-ROC, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve plots.

How to Run
Save the code for this project as hospital_readmission_analysis.py.

Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn

Run from terminal: python hospital_readmission_analysis.py

Key Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn
